This is my Java IRC Client and Server.

Commands:
	!sound [on : off] | default: off
		- on: turns notification sound on
		- off: turns notification sound off
	
	!timer [seconds] | default: 15
		- seconds: seconds that you want notification timer to take before beeping 
			       again when a new message comes in
	
	!quit
		- quits the appilcation
		
	!link [link]
		- link: paste the link here (The only time you can click the link is if you click on (0, 0) of the line. Will be fixed soonish)
	
	!clear
		- clears the chat
		

If you press the up arrow, it displays the last sent message.
Pressing down arrow clears the chat.

TODO:

	make server give global ip

	Make it where images can be sent over network

	Make hyperlink support work no matter where you click on the line. (Now only works if you click on the top (0,0) of the line)
